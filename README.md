# Cloud Microsegmentation Demo Simulation

Welcome to the Microsegmentation Demo Simulation App! This project is designed to highlight the power of Illumio's Cloudsecure by demonstrating its ability to secure and microsegment a vulnerable application environment effectively.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how Illumio Cloudsecure can be leveraged to implement microsegmentation within a complex cloud environment.

Microsegmentation is a critical aspect of modern network security, and Illumio provides robust solutions for Microsegmentation. This demo simulation serves as a realistic, intentionally vulnerable application that users can use alongside Illumio Cloudsecure to witness firsthand how microsegmentation enhances security.
